About this Package:
This package is part of a lager collection of isometric tiles.
The Ice Dungeon is the first dungeon pack. Thematically a rather unusual choice, but it marks the starting point of a series of dungeon themed tilesets that I am planning to create.
These tiles were created with the aim to help developers and hobbyists alike, to focus on gameplay and stories and not worry about the tremendous costs that developing custom art involves.
Each package involves many hundrets hours of work and a lifetime of learning and training art creation.
If it were a freelance commission, it would easily entail costs of over 10k.
Most indie developers and hobbyists simply do not have this money (I wouldn't), so I decided that I wish to offer these assets at a very affordable price for everybody.
The license includes using the assets in commercial projects.
CAUTION: The re-distribution of access to the art assets in any form (even altered) is not allowed, without my explicit consent.
At this point in time, I am creating these assets in my freetime, besides working a 9 to 5. My dream is to switch to fulltime creation of asset packs. I have a ton of ideas and plans, ranging from various themes, to characters to hand-painted 3D packs in my style, up to offering full project kits, that you can use to tell your stories.
If you would like to support my work in any form, it would be highly appreciated.
If you end up making monetary success with your game that uses these assets, I kindly ask you for your support of my work in form of a voluntary donation, so I can continue to create these assets.

Support:
The licenses for my packs are for lifetime, any future updates included.
So if you find anything missing or wrong with the package, feel free to join my discord and we can chat about the possibility to extend the pack and add more content to them. 
Please keep in mind, that I am one person, and the creation of new Packages has a higher priority, but I do my best to listen and take your opinions into account, to accomodate your wishes and needs as much as possible.
